# chessclub

This is a static website commissioned for Tony Niccoli's afterschool chess business.
The core HTML is from Bootstrap 4 allowing a fully responsive site. The HTML and CSS are an original design. However, Tony also wanted a static site that would be easy to update, but without using an off-the-shelf CMS. 

To see the repository with the NodeJS version of this website please click <a href="https://github.com/cswarbreck/chess-with-tony">here</a>. Whilst some of the design has been kept from this original project, the new site has been redesigned around the data neede for the templating engine to render data from the <a href="www.keystonejs.com">KeystoneJS</a> CMS.
