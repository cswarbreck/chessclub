# chessclub

This is a static website commissioned for Tony Niccoli's afterschool chess business.
The core HTML is from Bootstrap 4 allowing a fully responsive site. The HTML and CSS are an original design. Tony wanted a static site that would be easy to update, but without using an off-the-shelf CMS. Currently working on a NodeJS application to help him manage his content going forward.
